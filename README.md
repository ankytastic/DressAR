## DressAR not Dresser

Welcome to the **AI Dress Generator**! This innovative project merges artificial intelligence with augmented reality (AR) to help you design and visualize stunning outfits. Whether you're refreshing your wardrobe or just having some fashion fun, this tool is here to make your dress-up experience seamless and exciting.

## Getting Started

To get your development environment up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Begin by installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 2. Set Up the API

For the AI to generate dress images, you'll need to set up an API. Here’s how:

1. **Create an API on Buildship:**
   - Visit [Buildship](https://buildship.run) and create an API for generating dress prompts.
   - Keep the URL provided for your new API handy.

2. **Update the API Endpoint:**
   - Open `src/app/page.tsx` in your project.
   - Replace the placeholder URL `https://unknown.buildship.run/get-prompt-cloth-image` with the URL you received from Buildship.

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### 4. Open in Browser

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start designing your AI-generated outfits and visualizing them in AR.

## How It Works

The AI Dress Generator allows you to create unique dress designs based on your inputs. After generating your dress, use the AR visualizer to see how it looks in a real-world environment. It’s perfect for those moments when you want to preview your outfit before making a commitment!

### Editing the Page

You can start modifying the page by editing `src/app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update with your changes, allowing for rapid development and iteration.

   *“Fashion is the armor to survive the reality of everyday life. Or just a really cool way to look good!”*
